This is going to be a relatively short post as I am writing this to shed light on the situation of a bot I built a few years ago called BookBot.
Current Situation
As part of Discord&rsquo;s safety policy, verified bots have to be periodically re-verified. The last time the bot was verified was 3 years ago.
It used to be added to around ~2850 servers and actively running before Discord enforced re-verification."><meta name=author content><link rel=canonical href=https://rv178.is-a.dev/misc/the-bookbot-situation/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.4c0ce3745d59cd88c8fd0fb64fa67a3166037eaf6310c939324d26139274d829.css integrity="sha256-TAzjdF1ZzYjI/Q+2T6Z6MWYDfq9jEMk5Mk0mE5J02Ck=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rv178/website/main/static/favicon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rv178/website/main/static/favicon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rv178/website/main/static/favicon.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rv178/website/main/static/favicon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rv178/website/main/static/favicon.png><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://rv178.is-a.dev/misc/the-bookbot-situation/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style></noscript><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.16.22/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-5TcZemv2l/9On385z///+d7MSYlvIEw9FuZTIdZ14vJLqWphw7e7ZPuOiCHJcFCP crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.16.22/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-cMkvdD8LoxVzGF/RPUKAcvmm49FQ0oxwDF3BGKtDXcEc+T1b2N+teh/OJfpU0jr6 crossorigin=anonymous></script><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.16.22/dist/contrib/auto-render.min.js integrity=sha384-hCXGrW6PitJEwbkoStFjeJxv+fSOOQKOPbJxSfM6G5sWZjAyWhXiTIIAmQqnlLlh crossorigin=anonymous onload=renderMathInElement(document.body)></script><script>document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded",function(){renderMathInElement(document.body,{delimiters:[{left:"$$",right:"$$",display:!0},{left:"$",right:"$",display:!1}]})})</script><meta property="og:title" content="The Bookbot Situation"><meta property="og:description" content="
