      <description>So hi! I have been using Linux for almost 5 months now and I have learned a lot! Just wanted to share my experience with everyone.
When I asked my friend (who is an expert in Linux), he recommended me Pop!_OS, an Ubuntu based distro. So, I installed it and it was my first Linux distribution. My experience using Pop!_OS was amazing and it still is one of my favourite distributions.</description>
