      <description>Welcome to part 3 - or 4, (I only know how to count up to 3) of my dev-blog series on writing a chess engine. Like always, suggestions are welcome!
Hyperbola quintessence? This is the definition from chessprogramming.org:
Hyperbola Quintessence applies the o^(o-2r)-trick also for vertical or diagonal negative Rays - by reversing the bit-order of up to one bit per rank or byte with a vertical flip aka x86-64 bswap.</description>

      <title>Bitboards in Rust</title>

      <description>Introduction Hello there! I haven&amp;rsquo;t posted in a while because I was working on my chess engine. Specifically, representing the pieces as bitboards. Now you may ask what a bitboard is. You can use bitboards to represent a chess board in a piece-centric manner. What is so special about bitboards then? Doesn&amp;rsquo;t a piece list do the same thing? Well, representing a bitboard only requires a single unsigned 64 bit integer!</description>

      <title>Yew.rs With TailwindCSS</title>

      <description>Yew Like a lot of people, I think WASM is the future. Yew is an amazing frontend framework that helps in building web apps using WASM.
It&amp;rsquo;s incredibly easy to use and the performance of the app is EXTREMELY fast! I&amp;rsquo;m currently re-writing Snowstry with yew.rs for the frontend (switching from NextJS). Here&amp;rsquo;s the repo link.
Yew + Tailwind Setting up yew with tailwind was very easy as well. If you don&amp;rsquo;t know what tailwind is, here&amp;rsquo;s the link to their website.</description>

      <title>Writing a Build Automation Tool</title>

      <description>After using GNU Make for automating the build step in my projects, I had this idea of making my own build automation tool like Make.
I originally wanted to use Makefile-like syntax for the config file but instead settled with TOML after thinking about it for a while. I also used Rust to write this since I am kinda familiar with the language.
Rust has a TOML crate for parsing TOML files.</description>

      <title>FEN String Parsing in Rust</title>

      <description>I finally finished the FEN string parsing part of my chess engine after days of procrastinating and I just wanted to share my experience with everyone.
So a FEN string looks like this:
rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1 This is the FEN string of the starting position in standard chess. It looks like random crap at first glance but this string conveys a lot of information.
So let&amp;rsquo;s divide it into parts.</description>
